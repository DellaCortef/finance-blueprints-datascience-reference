    "# Machine Learning in Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmic Trading means carrying out trades autonomously. Originating in the 1970s, algorithmic trading (sometimes called Automated Trading Systems) involves using pre-programmed automated trading instructions to make extremely fast and objective trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning promises to take Algorithmic Trading to new heights. In addition to the most advanced strategies being able to be employed and adapted in real time, techniques based on machine learning can offer even more ways to obtain special insights into market movements. Most hedge funds and financial institutions do not openly reveal their machine learning-based approaches to trading, but machine learning is playing an increasingly important role in real-time calibration of trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Portfolio Management and Advisory Robots\n",
    "\n",
    "Wealth and asset management firms are exploring potential artificial intelligence solutions to improve their investment decisions and make use of their valuable collections of historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this is the use of *robo advisors*, which are algorithms created to calibrate a financial portfolio to the objectives and risk tolerance of its user. Additionally, they offer automated financial consultancy and services for investors and end customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user enters their financial goals (for example, retiring at age 65 with R$3.000.000,00 saved), age, income and financial assets they have. The advisor diversifies investments across various asset classes and financial instruments to achieve the user's objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system then adapts to changes in the user's objectives and the market in real time, always seeking to find the best option for the user's original objectives. Robo advisors have gained significant traction among consumers who don't need a human advisor to feel comfortable investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fraud Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud is a huge problem for financial institutions and one of the main reasons to boost machine learning in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there is a significant data security risk due to high computing power, frequent internet use and an increasing amount of business data being stored online. While previous financial fraud detection systems relied heavily on complex and robust sets of rules, modern fraud detection goes beyond following a checklist of risk factors - it learns and adjusts to new potential or actual security threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is ideally suited to combat fraudulent financial transactions. That's because its systems can scan huge data sets, detect unusual activity, and flag it immediately. Given the incalculably high number of ways that security can be breached, genuine machine learning systems will be an absolute necessity in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loan/Credit Card/Insurance Underwriting\n",
    "\n",
    "Underwriting can be described as a perfect fit for machine learning in finance, and there is certainly a lot of concern in the industry that machines will replace a large portion of current underwriting positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially in large companies (large banks and publicly traded insurance companies), machine learning algorithms can be trained with millions of examples of consumer data on the outcomes of their loans and insurance, for example, whether the person defaulted on their home loan or mortgage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underlying financial trends can be assessed with algorithms and continually analyzed to detect biases that may influence risk in future lending and insurance underwriting. Algorithms can perform automated tasks such as linking data records, identifying exceptions, and calculating whether an applicant qualifies for a credit and insurance product.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automation and Chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation is obviously compatible with finance. It reduces the strain that repetitive, low-value tasks place on human employees. Furthermore, it solves routine and day-to-day processes, freeing teams to complete their high-value work. As a result, it saves huge amounts of time and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding machine learning and AI to the automation mix offers another level of support for employees. With access to relevant data, machine learning and AI can provide deep data analysis to help finance teams make difficult decisions. In some cases, they can even recommend the best actions for processes to be approved and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI and automation in the financial sector can also learn to recognize errors, reducing the time wasted between discovery and resolution. This means there is less chance of human team members delaying their reports, thus being able to complete the work with fewer errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI chatbots can be implemented to support consumers of financial and banking products. With the rise in popularity of real-time chat software in banking and finance companies, chatbots are the natural revolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning techniques are transforming how we approach risk management. Every aspect of understanding and controlling risk is being revolutionized through the growth of machine learning-powered solutions. Examples range from deciding how much a bank should lend to a customer to improving compliance and reducing the risk model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asset price prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Active price prediction is considered the most sophisticated and frequently discussed area of ​​finance. Predicting asset prices allows a person to understand the factors that influence the market and speculate on asset performance. Traditionally, predicting asset prices was done by analyzing financial reports and market performance to determine what position to take for a specific security or asset class. However, with a spectacular increase in the amount of financial data, traditional approaches to analysis and stock selection strategies are being supplemented with machine learning-based techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivatives Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent successes of machine learning, as well as the rapid pace of innovation, indicate that machine learning applications for derivatives pricing are likely to be widely used in the coming years. The world of Black and Scholes models, the volatility \"smile\" effect, and Excel spreadsheet models should begin to be less isolated as more advanced methods become readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classic derivatives pricing models are created based on several, impractical, hypotheses to reproduce an empirical relationship between the underlying input data (strike price, expiration time and type of option) and the price of derivatives observed in the market. Machine learning methods are not based on multiple hypotheses; they just try to estimate a function between the input data and the price, minimizing the difference between the model results and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "The faster speed of deployment enabled by machine learning tools enabled by next-generation ML tools is just one of the advantages that will accelerate the use of machine learning in derivatives pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis involves carefully reading massive volumes of unstructured data, such as videos, transcripts, photos, audio files, social media posts, articles, and business documents, to determine market sentiment. Sentiment analysis is crucial for all companies in today's market and is an excellent example of machine learning in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of sentiment analysis in the financial sector is the analysis of financial news - in particular, predicting market behavior and possible trends. The stock market moves in reaction to myriad human-related factors, and it is expected that machine learning will be able to replicate and enhance human intuition related to financial activities by discovering new trends and revealing signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, much of the future applications of machine learning will be in understanding social media, news trends and other data sources related to predicting consumer sentiment regarding market developments. They will not be limited to just predicting stock prices and trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Settlement\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial settlement is the process of transferring securities to the buyer's account and cash to the seller's account, after the transaction of a financial asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although most financial settlements are carried out automatically and with little or no human interaction, around 30% of them need to be done manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of machine learning can not only identify why settlements were not carried out, but can also analyze why the transaction was rejected, offer a solution, and predict which transactions may fail in the future. What would normally require five to ten minutes for a human to solve, machine learning can do in a fraction of a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Money Laundering\n",
    "\n",
    "A UN report estimates that the amount of money laundered worldwide per year is between 2% and 5% of global GDP. Machine learning trends can analyze internal, public, and transactional data from a broader network of customers in an attempt to identify signs of money laundering."

    "## Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "For most people, the terms *machine learning*, *deep learning*, *artificial intelligence*, and *data science* are confusing. In fact, many use these terms interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the relationships between AI, machine learning, deep learning and data science.
