    "\n",
    "These are some of the reasons for Python's popularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- high-level syntax (compared to lower-level languages ​​like C, Java, and C++). Applications can be developed by writing fewer lines of code, making Python attractive to both beginners and advanced programmers;\n",
    "- efficient development life cycle;\n",
    "- large collection of community-run and open-source libraries;\n",
    "- strong portability.\n",

    "### Blueprint de Desenvolvimento de Modelo\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will detail each step of the model development process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Problem definition**\n",
    "The first step in any project is defining the problem. Powerful algorithms can be used to solve it, but the results will be of no use if the wrong problem is solved.\n",
    "The following framework should be used to define the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. describe the problem informally and formally. List similar assumptions and problems;\n",
    "    2. list the motivation for solving the problem, the benefits brought by the resolution and how it will be used;\n",
    "    3. describe how the problem would be solved using domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Loading data and libs**\n",
    "The second step gives you everything you need to start working on the problem. This includes loading libraries, packages, and functions required for model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1. Loading the libs**\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from matplotlib import pyplot\n",
    "```\n",
    "Details of libraries and modules for specific functionalities can be found on each page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2. Loading data**\n",
    "The following items must be checked and removed before data is loaded:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - column headers;\n",
    "    - comments or characters;\n",
    "    - delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to load data. Some of the most common are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Upload CSV files with Pandas\n",
    "from pandas import read_csv\n",
    "filename = 'xpto.csv'\n",
    "data = read_csv(filename, names=names)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Upload files from a URL\n",
    "url = 'https://goo.glvhm1eU'\n",
    "names = ['age', 'class']\n",
    "data = read_csv(url, names=names)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Load files using pandas_darareader\n",
    "import pandas_datareader.data as web\n",
    "ccy_tickers = ['DEXJPUS', 'DEXUSUK']\n",
    "idx_tickers = ['SP500', 'DJIA', 'VIXCLS']\n",
    "\n",
    "stk_data = web.DataReader(stk_tickers, 'yahoo')\n",
    "ccy_data = web.DataReader(ccy_tickers, 'fred')\n",
    "idx_data = web.DataReader(idx_tickers, 'fred')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Exploratory data analysis**\n",
    "In this step, we analyze the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1. Descriptive statistics**\n",
    "Understanding the dataset is one of the most important processes in model development. The steps to do this include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. view the raw data;\n",
    "    2. evaluate the dimensions of the set;\n",
    "    3. evaluate the types of data attributes;\n",
    "    4. summarize the distribution, descriptive statistics, and relationship between variables in the data set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "These steps are demonstrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# View data\n",
    "set_option('display.width', 100)\n",
    "dataset.head(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Evaluate dataset dimensions\n",
    "dataset.shape\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Evaluate data attribute types\n",
    "set_option('display.max_rows', 500)\n",
    "dataset.dtypes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Summarize data using descriptive statistics\n",
    "set_option('precision', 3)\n",
    "dataset.describe()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2. Data visualization**\n",
    "The quickest way to learn more about data is to visualize it. Visualization involves independently understanding each attribute of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of charts:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Univariates*\n",
    "- histograms and density graphs;\n",
    "\n",

    "- correlation matrix and scatter plot;\n",
