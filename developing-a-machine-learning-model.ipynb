    "\n",
    "These are some of the reasons for Python's popularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- high-level syntax (compared to lower-level languages ​​like C, Java, and C++). Applications can be developed by writing fewer lines of code, making Python attractive to both beginners and advanced programmers;\n",
    "- efficient development life cycle;\n",
    "- large collection of community-run and open-source libraries;\n",
    "- strong portability.\n",
